## 2024-05-23 - HistoryView Optimization **Learning:** React components inside large parent components (`App.jsx`) without stable callback references cause frequent re-renders of children, even if those children are heavy lists. **Action:** Always wrap actions passed to heavy list components in `useCallback` and use `React.memo` on the list component and its items. In this case, `HistoryView` was re-rendering on every keystroke in other views because `useProjectState` actions were unstable.

## 2024-05-24 - Input Stability **Learning:** When lifting state up to a common parent (like `App.jsx` via `useProjectState`) for inputs, every keystroke causes a full app re-render. Memoizing static siblings (`Sidebar`, `BottomNav`) is useless if their props (callbacks) are unstable. **Action:** Ensure all event handlers passed to layout components are wrapped in `useCallback` in the custom hook, then `React.memo` the layout components.

## 2024-05-25 - BlueprintStage List Optimization **Learning:** `BlueprintStage` couples high-frequency chat input state with a heavy `framer-motion` list (`FeatureCard`). Without `React.memo`, typing in the chat triggers re-renders of all feature cards, causing input lag. **Action:** Memoize all list item components (`FeatureCard`) that are rendered alongside interactive inputs, especially when using animation libraries like `framer-motion`.
