## 2024-05-23 - HistoryView Optimization **Learning:** React components inside large parent components (`App.jsx`) without stable callback references cause frequent re-renders of children, even if those children are heavy lists. **Action:** Always wrap actions passed to heavy list components in `useCallback` and use `React.memo` on the list component and its items. In this case, `HistoryView` was re-rendering on every keystroke in other views because `useProjectState` actions were unstable.

## 2024-05-24 - Input Stability **Learning:** When lifting state up to a common parent (like `App.jsx` via `useProjectState`) for inputs, every keystroke causes a full app re-render. Memoizing static siblings (`Sidebar`, `BottomNav`) is useless if their props (callbacks) are unstable. **Action:** Ensure all event handlers passed to layout components are wrapped in `useCallback` in the custom hook, then `React.memo` the layout components.

## 2024-05-25 - Token Usage Optimization **Learning:** Small utility components that perform seemingly cheap operations (like `JSON.stringify` on a list) can become bottlenecks if they re-render on every keystroke of a parent input. **Action:** Memoize components that perform array/object iteration or serialization, even if they look small. Use `useMemo` for derived statistics to prevent main-thread blocking during high-frequency updates like typing.

## 2024-05-25 - BlueprintStage List Optimization **Learning:** `BlueprintStage` couples high-frequency chat input state with a heavy `framer-motion` list (`FeatureCard`). Without `React.memo`, typing in the chat triggers re-renders of all feature cards, causing input lag. **Action:** Memoize all list item components (`FeatureCard`) that are rendered alongside interactive inputs, especially when using animation libraries like `framer-motion`.

## 2024-05-26 - Global Input Isolation **Learning:** Lifting state up to a global provider for high-frequency inputs causes massive re-render trees, making typing laggy. **Action:** Isolate high-frequency inputs in local state. Sync to global state only on Blur or Submit. Pass the local value directly to action handlers to ensure consistency without waiting for React state updates.

## 2025-02-18 - QuestionsStage Optimization **Learning:** In lists of controlled inputs (like `QuestionsStage`), defining handlers inline inside `map` breaks memoization, causing O(N) re-renders on every keystroke. **Action:** Extract the input item to a `React.memo` component (`QuestionItem`) and pass a stable `useCallback` handler that accepts an index.
