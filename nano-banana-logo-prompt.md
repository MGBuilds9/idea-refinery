# Idea Refinery Logo — Nano Banana Pro Prompt

## Core Concept
Create a **premium, refined logo** for "**Idea Refinery**" — an AI-powered web app that transforms raw project ideas into polished technical blueprints and visual mockups. The brand essence is about **transformation, refinement, and creative alchemy**.

---

## Logo Requirements

### Style Direction
- **Modern & Sophisticated** — Not playful or cartoonish; think premium tech product
- **Minimal & Clean** — Works at small sizes (favicon) and large (hero display)
- **Dark Mode Native** — Primary use case is on dark slate/charcoal backgrounds
- **Timeless** — Avoid trendy effects that will date quickly

### Visual Metaphors to Explore
Combine 2-3 of these concepts into a cohesive mark:

1. **Refinery/Distillation** — The transformation of raw material into something pure
2. **Sparkles/Light** — Moments of brilliance and clarity (currently uses sparkle icon)
3. **Lightbulb → Diamond** — Raw idea becoming polished gem
4. **Alchemical Symbol** — Transformation, transmutation, creation
5. **Abstract Flame/Heat** — The furnace of refinement
6. **Geometric Crystallization** — Ideas solidifying into structure

### Color Palette
| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Amber/Gold** | `#F59E0B` | Primary accent — signifies warmth, creativity, premium quality |
| **Slate 900** | `#0F172A` | Deep background |
| **Slate 800** | `#1E293B` | Secondary background |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Text and highlights |

> **Note:** The logo should work in:
> - Full color on dark backgrounds
> - Monochrome white for light backgrounds
> - Single amber/gold color as an icon

### Typography Reference
The app uses:
- **Playfair Display** (elegant serif) for the wordmark "Idea Refinery"
- **IBM Plex Mono** for technical/UI elements

If including a wordmark, consider using Playfair Display or a similar elegant serif. However, a **standalone icon/symbol** that works without text is the priority.

---

## Deliverables Requested

1. **Primary Logo Mark** — Symbol/icon that encapsulates the brand
2. **Logo + Wordmark** — Horizontal lockup with "Idea Refinery" text
3. **Favicon variant** — Should be legible at 32x32px

## What to Avoid
- ❌ Generic lightbulb icons
- ❌ Overly literal factory/industrial imagery
- ❌ Busy or complex designs
- ❌ Gradients that don't work in monochrome
- ❌ Trendy "blob" or liquid shapes
- ❌ Anything that looks like a SaaS startup from 2018

## Reference Context
**Built by MKG Builds** — The app has a sleek, dark UI with subtle glassmorphism effects, amber accent buttons, and elegant serif typography. It serves "vibe-coders" and non-traditional developers who value aesthetics as much as functionality. The logo should feel at home next to brands like **Notion**, **Linear**, **Arc Browser**, or **Raycast**.
